# Optimizer Framework Documentation
=====================================

The Optimizer Framework provides a set of tools for improving the performance and efficiency of intelligent agents. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Agent Framework, allowing developers to easily integrate optimization techniques into their agent-based applications.

## Key Components

*   `Optimizer`: The core interface that defines the optimization process. Optimizers can be used to modify the agent's behavior, improve its decision-making, or enhance its overall performance.

## Optimizers

### RemoveErrorActivitiesOptimizer

This optimizer removes error activities from the agent's history, ensuring that the agent does not learn from or rely on faulty information.

#### Usage

```typescript
import { RemoveErrorActivitiesOptimizer } from '@caretakerai/optimizer';

const optimizer = new RemoveErrorActivitiesOptimizer();
const optimizedActivities = await optimizer.optimize(activities);
```


### LengthOptimizer

This optimizer limits the number of activities in the agent's context, preventing the agent from becoming overwhelmed with excessive information.

#### Usage

```typescript
import { LengthOptimizer } from '@caretakerai/optimizer';

const optimizer = new LengthOptimizer(10); // Limit the context to 10 activities
const optimizedActivities = await optimizer.optimize(activities);
```


## Creating Custom Optimizers

Developers can create their own custom optimizers by implementing the `Optimizer` interface. This allows for the creation of specialized optimizers tailored to specific use cases or applications.

#### Example

```typescript
import { Activity, Optimizer } from '@caretakerai/agent';

export class CustomOptimizer implements Optimizer {
  async optimize(activities: Activity[]): Promise<Activity[]> {
    // Implement custom optimization logic here
    return optimizedActivities;
  }
}
```


## Integration with the Agent Framework

Optimizers can be easily integrated into the Agent Framework by passing an array of optimizers to the `Agent` constructor. The optimizers will be executed in the order they are provided, allowing for the creation of complex optimization pipelines.

#### Example

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@caretakerai/agent';
import { RemoveErrorActivitiesOptimizer } from '@caretakerai/optimizer';
import { LengthOptimizer } from '@caretakerai/optimizer';

const agent = new Agent({
  // ... other parameters ...
  optimizers: [
    new RemoveErrorActivitiesOptimizer(), // Remove error activities
    new LengthOptimizer(16), // Limit the context to 16 activities
  ],
});
```


By leveraging the Optimizer Framework, developers can create more efficient, effective, and intelligent agents that can adapt to complex environments and tasks.
